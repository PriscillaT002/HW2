we need a loop that asks the user to choose a number to execute one of the following 10 functions
1getScore(): get my score, returns the score of students
2getRank(): get my rank, returns the ranks of all students
3perfectScoreQ(): did anybody receive a perfect score of (say) 100 (points)? Answer is True or False.
4bottomScoreQ(): did anybody receive a score of 0 points? Answer is True or False.
5getMaxScore(): get the maximum score. 
6nrMaxScores(): how many students received the maximum score?
7getMinScore(): get the minimum score
8nrMinScores(): how many students received the minimum score?
9sortedScores(): get a sorted list of all the scores (without any information about the id associated to each score).
10 quit

****Total: 8 students, total index of 7, Associated scores: 1:50, 2:34, 3:88, 4:92, 5:0, 6:100, 7:72, 8:99


****Loop has been create, will now need to create functions and tests and incorporate into each option

****Main issue, I still don't understand the concept on how to associate student IDs with grades so I coded my away around
the issue and found solutions within my loop.
