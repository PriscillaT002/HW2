we need a loop that asks the user to choose a number to execute one of the following 10 functions
1getScore(): get my score (needs the id of the student)
2getRank(): get my rank (needs the id of the student)
3perfectScoreQ(): did anybody receive a perfect score of (say) 100 (points)? Answer is True or False.
4bottomScoreQ(): did anybody receive a score of 0 points? Answer is True or False.
5getMaxScore(): get the maximum score. 
6nrMaxScores(): how many students received the maximum score?
7getMinScore(): get the minimum score
8nrMinScores(): how many students received the minimum score?
9sortedScores(): get a sorted list of all the scores (without any information about the id associated to each score).
10quit

****Total: 8 students, index of 7, Associated scores: 1:50, 2:34, 3:88, 4:92, 5:0, 6:100, 7:72, 8:99


****Loop has been create, will now need to create functions and tests and incorporate into each option
****Main issue, I don't know how to code a way to jump out of the loop so if the user wants to use any other function they
will have to restart the entire program 


****Finish functions for getscore, getrank, highest score recipients, lowest score recipients, clean up code
